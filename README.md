# sphinx-stack

Full stack Sphinx cluster, including:

- bitcoind
- LND
- relay
- sphinx-tribes
- sphinx-memes
- sphinx-auth
- sphinx-mqtt

### run

Open a terminal inside the root directory of this repository. Then:

`docker-compose pull`

`docker-compose up -d`

### stop

`docker-compose down`

Running `docker-compose down` instead of sending a SIGINT or SIGTERM is very important! Otherwise `bitcoind` will not finish writing to its database, and on the next run LND will crash with a block index mismatch.

You can also run with `Docker Desktop` and just use the "play" and "stop" buttons (and view the logs from each container).

### developing/contributing to Sphinx

- Run one of the sphinx clients on your local computer, and enter the `exported_keys` that you can find in `/relay/NODES.json` (make sure to copy the trailing `=` equal signs if there are any!)
- the easiest client to get up and running is (Sphinx Desktop)[https://github.com/stakwork/sphinx-win-linux-desktop]
- To find out how to modify sphinx components and contribute to the stack vist (Developing on Sphinx)[https://github.com/stakwork/sphinx-stack/blob/master/docs/developingOnSphind.md]
- To find out how to develop bots on the sphinx stack visit (Developing bots on sphinx)[https://github.com/stakwork/sphinx-stack/blob/master/docs/bots.md]

### troubleshooting

There's lots of moving pieces! On a slower computer (or an M1 mac), do `export COMPOSE_HTTP_TIMEOUT=120` first
